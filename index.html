        <h2>Real-World Coding Projects You Can Finish In Under 1 Hour</h2>
        <p>Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.<br>
            Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there's a problem: <br>
            All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.<br>
            With our knowledge of JavaScript, let's convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.</p>
